## Tools to help you automate the VBP process

Discovery of the many different moving pieces in a software supply chain (SSC) is often laborious, so the use of tools to automate and speed up the process is important.  Below are a few tools that I've used recently to help me leverage the VBP framework.

### One tool to rule them all:

If you want one tool that will help you identify all the components in a software supply chain, you can check out [SecureStack](https://securestack.com).  You can create a free account [HERE](https://app.securestack.com)

### Trivy

Trivy is a great software composition analysis (SCA) tool that lets you do several things at once.  It will scan containers, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and source code for vulnerable third-party libraries.  You can find it at https://trivy.dev/

### Semgrep

Semgrep is an open-source static analysis testing (SAST) tool that also supports credential scanning and more recently SCA.
